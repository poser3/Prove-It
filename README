Prove-It! strives to bring the construction of rich mathematical proofs (primarily geometric proofs) back into the classroom in a dynamic and exciting way.  It goes beyond previous tools like Geometer's Sketchpad or Cabri in that it not only lets students experiment with geometric constructions, and to observe the interesting relationships that result -- but it also lets students construct logical arguments for why these discovered relationships hold.
